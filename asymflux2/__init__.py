"""ComfyUI-AsymFLUX2 — native ComfyUI nodes for the pixel-space
AsymFLUX.2-klein 9B model from LakonLab (Asymmetric Flow Models,
arXiv 2605.12964).

Layout
------
- ``nodes/``    — V3 ``io.ComfyNode`` definitions exposed in the menu.
- ``model/``    — AsymFLUX2 model surgery + AsymFlow calibration/velocity.
- ``oklab_math.py`` — pure-tensor Oklab encode/decode (the "VAE" pair).

The node pack does NOT depend on the upstream ``lakonlab`` package — all
math is reimplemented against ComfyUI primitives.
